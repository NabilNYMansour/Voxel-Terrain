# Voxel-Terrain
This is a unity demo that showcases a randomly generated voxel terrain based on Minecraft. The terrain includes underground caves and can theoretically be infinite in size. The player can also place and remove blocks.

The script uses FastNoise library (https://github.com/Auburns/FastNoise) for generating random terrain. More specifically, the simplex noise algorithm.

To play the demo, go to Builds > VoxelGenerationTest3 and run the "Voxel Terrain" exe application. Previous iterations and attempts for the terrain also exist in the Builds file.

The following are screenshots for the Build:

This project was done for the purposes of learning voxel based algorithms and how to utilize unity game engine effectively.
